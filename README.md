Graph convolutional network are new to my level of understanding. It requires a lot of mathematics to understand them. But don't give up
on the way just take small steps. I have provided links at places where I have to go search on Internet and have tried to explain things myself as well. 
This might speed things for you I hope. 

Graph neural network are useful when we have to establish a connection between far distance edges. Unlike convolutional network GCN are
not limited by their filter size. Pytorch also provides easier way to develop GCN by their library - https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Although it misses the fun of coding on yourself.

https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric is library's developer github where he has also provided link of important papers.

This is a Pytorch based implementation so you will need it to be installed. Herein this example dataset is small so there is no need of GPU.
Although writer of papers have themselves used CPU. Graph neural networks do not support transfer learning.
